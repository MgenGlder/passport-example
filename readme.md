# Passport Example
###### Using passport for authentication with a Node.js Express application
---


Using Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and a small amount of embedded javascript html pages.

This was run and tested using Node.js v9.5.0 and MongoDB v3.6.2

## Running It 
* Navigate to the project folder
* Run a local mongo server with the ``` mongod``` command in your terminal or command prompt.
* Update the __config/database.js__ file to make sure the mognodb url is correct for you. If you've taken the local option, the url there should be correct as that is the default for mongodb.
* Run the server using the ```node server.js``` command.
* Navigate to your web browser and go the web address ```localhost:8080/```
* You should now see the base web page. From there, feel free to sign up, log in, and log out!
